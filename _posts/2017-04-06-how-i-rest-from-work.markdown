The home of the future will not be only about controlling appliances through the smartphone. With the advancements in Artificial Intelligence and IoT, houses will be finally smart enough to make a big difference where we spend most of our times. To achieve that, there should be interoperability with different sectors inside the society specially the utilities sector. The open access to data from those sectors can add up to the house occupants patterns along with the sensor data to create an actual intelligent system that lead to better comfort and more energy savings.

The connection of this system to the utilities sector can make use of the dynamic pricing of the smart grid in real-time which aim at modifying the consumerâ€™s demand profile, in time and/or shape, to make it match the supply also allows to efficiently incorporate renewable energy resources , facilitates the integration of distributed generation, and eases handling emergency situations. The rescheduling of user energy usage patterns in response to the variance of price can lead to reduction of demand at peak times .Thus, having a good environmental impact and reduction on the electricity bill.
